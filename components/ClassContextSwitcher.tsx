/**
 * Shows which class (and subject) the teacher is working in, and lets them
 * switch when they have more than one assignment.
 *
 * Three states, by design:
 *   - no assignments  → renders nothing. A pre-V2 account keeps the exact UI it
 *                       had; the feature pages fall back to `teacher_id` scoping.
 *   - one assignment  → a static chip. Deliberately *not* dressed as a control:
 *                       a caret that opens a menu with one item in it is a lie,
 *                       and the previous chip's problem was precisely that it
 *                       looked like something it was not. It is labelled instead,
 *                       so it reads as the context it is.
 *   - many            → `SearchableSelect`, which already carries everything an
 *                       explicit control owes the user: a visible caret,
 *                       `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, a live `aria-expanded`,
 *                       arrow-key and Home/End traversal, Escape-to-close with
 *                       focus returned to the trigger, and a filter field for a
 *                       teacher carrying eight classes. Hand-rolling a second
 *                       dropdown here would be a worse copy of it.
 *
 * Selection lives in `TeacherContext`, never `localStorage`, so two tabs cannot
 * disagree about which class is being edited.
